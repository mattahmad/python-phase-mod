Example from https://www.rfwireless-world.com/source-code/Python/PM-modulation-demodulation-python-code.html
Key takeaway:  Analog modulation types include AM, FM, PM etc. Digital modulation types include ASK, FSK, PSK etc. Unlike PSK, PM modulation takes analog message signal. In PSK modulation, binary digital data signal is taken as input.
